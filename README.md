# tensorflow_eager_planning
My implementation of Thrun's planning algorithm using TensorFlow's Eager Execution and Open Ai's Gym environment for my bachelor thesis.

The requirements.yml file is an export of my conda environment, containing the modules I used while creating this thesis.
If you want to use tensorflow_gpu with this, install this file after installing the tensorflow_gpu dependencies.

To execute the notebook, they need to be at the same level as the python files. I put them in a seperate folder for cleanliness.
